T-Cubed - A Game of X's and O's
=============

T-Cubed is a game I created over a weekend to port a popular variant of Tic-Tac-Toe to computer.

I plan to make a .js version of this game but the rules are simple: Think outside the box and try to get three-in-a-row in a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game. You play on every board at the same time and the next place you play is determined by your opponent. This is a two player game offline game.

Missing Dependencies: I included the missing dependency file, but I have no idea how to get it work unless you install all the dll's. Windows hates other OS's, even its own.

## Update!

I ported this to p5.js. Play the game here: https://editor.p5js.org/AmritAmar/present/x2dtFTAsH
